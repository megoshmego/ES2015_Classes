can you please evaluate the the following and provide scripts / snippets to learn the material? 




- [Lecturer] Next up, we've got a pretty big topic,
0:06
big both in terms of importance,
0:08
it's essential to JavaScript,
0:10
also big as in there's a lot to talk about.
0:13
We're talking about objects, object orientation,
0:16
or object-oriented programming, or OOP in JavaScript.
0:20
We're gonna cover a lot.
0:22
We'll talk about how objects work in JavaScript.
0:25
We're already familiar with them at this point,
0:26
but there's more to just storing numbers
0:29
and strings and bully into objects.
0:30
So we'll talk about how objects work.
0:32
We'll learn how to define classes in JavaScript.
0:35
So this is actually new with IAS 2015.
0:38
We'll talk about object-oriented JavaScript without classes,
0:41
and with the new class, Syntax.
0:43
We'll use classes to make instances
0:45
so we can share functionality across different objects.
0:48
We'll talk about constructor functions and we'll use them
0:51
to create new instances of objects that follow patterns.
0:55
We'll talk about the mysterious new keyword in JavaScript.
0:58
We'll talk about inheritance.
1:00
We'll learn how to share functionality across objects
1:03
and inherit functionality from other objects.
1:05
And then we'll also cover some commonly used
1:08
and somewhat scary sounding terms
1:10
in object-oriented programming,
1:11
like encapsulation and polymorphism.
1:15
So we've got a lot to cover.
1:16
We're gonna start in the next video
1:18
with a quick recap of how objects work
1:20
and some of their quirks.
