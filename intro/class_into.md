Based on the instructions and descriptions given, I will provide a JavaScript snippet that follows the pattern of creating classes and methods, and instances of those classes. Then, I'll enhance the snippet with additional features and improvements, step by step.

**Step 1: Define a Class and Add Methods**

We start with the basic class definition and add methods to it. In the following example, a `Triangle` class is defined, which has two methods: `greet` and `display`.

```javascript
class Triangle {
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello from Triangle.');
  }

  display() {
    console.log(`Triangle with sides of ${this.a} and ${this.b}`);
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Create Instances of the Class**

We can now create instances of the `Triangle` class and use the methods defined in the class.

```javascript
const firstTri = new Triangle();
const secondTri = new Triangle();

firstTri.greet(); // Logs 'Hello from Triangle.'
secondTri.greet(); // Logs 'Hello from Triangle.'
```

**Step 3: Add Properties to Instances**

Our triangle class expects `a` and `b` to be properties of instances, let's add them manually.

```javascript
firstTri.a = 3;
firstTri.b = 4;

secondTri.a = 9;
secondTri.b = 12;

firstTri.display(); // Logs 'Triangle with sides of 3 and 4'
secondTri.display(); // Logs 'Triangle with sides of 9 and 12'
```

**Improvement: Using Constructor Function**

Adding properties manually to each instance is not efficient, so we use a `constructor` method in our class. This special method gets called whenever a new object is created with this class.

```javascript
class Triangle {
  constructor(a, b) {
    this.a = a;
    this.b = b;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log('Hello from Triangle.');
  }

  display() {
    console.log(`Triangle with sides of ${this.a} and ${this.b}`);
  }
}

const firstTri = new Triangle(3, 4);
const secondTri = new Triangle(9, 12);

firstTri.display(); // Logs 'Triangle with sides of 3 and 4'
secondTri.display(); // Logs 'Triangle with sides of 9 and 12'
```

Now when you create a new instance of `Triangle`, you can pass the side lengths `a` and `b` directly as arguments. The `constructor` method assigns these values to the instance properties, making the code more efficient and clean.

I recommend you practice this pattern of creating classes, adding methods, and creating instances with different classes to solidify your understanding of this essential JavaScript concept.
