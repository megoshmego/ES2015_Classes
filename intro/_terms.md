Sure, here are the terms with their definitions:

1. **Defining a Class**: A class in JavaScript is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class.

2. **Constructor Method**: A special method within a class for creating and initializing objects. It is automatically called when a new object is created from a class using the `new` keyword.

3. **Instance Properties**: Properties assigned to the object being created inside the constructor using the `this` keyword.

4. **Creating Instances**: The process of creating a new object from a class using the `new` keyword.

5. **Method Definition**: The process of defining methods within a class. These methods can be used on any object created from the class.

6. **Data Validation**: Ensuring the correctness of data within the constructor. If data is invalid, the constructor throws an error.

7. **Methods**: Functions that are properties on an object. When added to classes, these are referred to as instance methods.

8. **The `this` keyword**: Refers to the specific instance the method is called on within instance methods.

9. **Returning values from methods**: Methods can perform actions as well as return values.

10. **Accepting arguments**: Instance methods can accept arguments to modify their behavior.

11. **Inheritance**: The principle in object-oriented programming where a new class is based on an existing class.

12. **Super keyword**: Used to call the parent class with the `this` value of the new object being constructed.

13. **Prototype**: A property of a function in JavaScript used to define methods and properties shared among all instances created with that function.

14. **Constructor Function**: A function that is used to create new objects.

15. **Adding methods to the prototype**: The process of adding methods to the prototype of a constructor function, allowing all instances of that function to share those methods.

16. **Accessing the Prototype**: Every object in JavaScript has a `__proto__` property that points to the object's prototype.

17. **Object Literal Syntax**: A way to create objects in JavaScript, using curly braces `{}`.

18. **Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO)**: A JavaScript object that doesn't inherit from other objects and isn't extended or altered in any way.

19. **Adding properties**: The process of adding properties to an object after it's been created.

20. **Object.keys()**: A method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

21. **Object.values()**: A method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values.

22. **Object.entries()**: A method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs.

23. **Undefined properties**: When you try to access a property that doesn't exist on an object, JavaScript will return `undefined`.

24. **String keys**: All keys in a JavaScript object are converted to strings.

25. **Calculations as keys**: The possibility to use calculations or expressions as property keys in an object.

26. **Encapsulation**: The principle of bundling data, and the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.

27. **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms. In JavaScript, all objects inherit from `Object.prototype` and can be instances of more than one class.
