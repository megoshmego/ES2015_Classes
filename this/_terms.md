Sure, here are the terms along with their brief definitions:

1. **The behavior of `this` in Regular Functions:** Regular function expressions in JavaScript create their own `this` value. When a function is called as a method on an object, `this` refers to the calling object.

2. **The behavior of `this` in Arrow Functions:** Arrow functions do not create their own `this` value. Instead, they inherit `this` from the surrounding scope.

3. **The behavior of `this` inside a function passed to another function:** When a function is passed as an argument to another function, the `this` inside that function refers to the global object (`window` in the browser, `global` in Node.js), not to the object on which the original method was called.

4. **Using `bind()` to fix `this`:** The `bind()` function can be used to ensure that `this` inside the callback function refers to the correct object.

5. **Using arrow functions to maintain the same `this`:** If an arrow function is used as the callback, the `bind()` function isn't necessary, because `this` inside the arrow function will automatically refer to `this` from the surrounding scope.

6. **JavaScript's `bind()` method:** The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value. Also, `bind()` allows arguments to be preset for the function when it's invoked.

7. **Using `bind()` in event handling:** `bind()` is often used in event handling to ensure that the correct context (`this`) is used when the event handler is invoked.

8. **The `call()` function in JavaScript:** The `call()` function allows a function to be called with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.

9. **JavaScript's strict mode:** JavaScript's strict mode changes some JavaScript behaviors to prevent common errors, like changing the default value of `this` from the global `window` object to `undefined` when the context of `this` is not set explicitly.

10. **Understanding `this` keyword in JavaScript:** The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It changes depending on whether the method is invoked directly from the object or if the method is stored in a separate variable and then called.

11. **`call` and `bind` methods in JavaScript:** The `call` method calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, while the `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value. 

12. **Value of "this" in JavaScript:** The value of "this" depends on how the function is called. If a function is defined inside an object, it's considered a method. When this method is called, "this" refers to the object it is called upon. If a function is called in the global context, "this" refers to the global object. In a browser, this is the Window object. If a function is just called without any object reference, it's like calling it on the global object. Even if the function is stored in a variable and called, it is the same as calling it on the global object.
