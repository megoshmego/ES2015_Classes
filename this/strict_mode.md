The above script seems to be talking about the JavaScript keyword `this` in different contexts and how its behavior changes when strict mode is engaged, especially with classes.

The speaker mentions using JavaScript's strict mode, which can change some JavaScript behaviors, like changing the default value of `this` from the global `window` object to `undefined` when the context of `this` is not set explicitly.

In the script, the speaker first constructs a simple `Cat` class that includes a `dance` method. This `dance` method logs a message that includes `this.breed` (the breed of the cat) and `danceType` (the type of dance the cat is supposed to do).

Let's provide a JavaScript snippet that simulates the speaker's script. This is the class definition:

```javascript
class Cat {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  dance(danceType) {
    console.log(this);
    console.log(`Meow, I am a ${this.breed} and I like to ${danceType}`);
  }
}
```

After creating an instance of the `Cat` class, the speaker calls the `dance` method:

```javascript
const rocket = new Cat('rocket', 'tabby');
rocket.dance('tango'); // "Meow, I am a tabby and I like to tango"
```

The speaker then isolates the `dance` method and calls it separately:

```javascript
const rocketDance = rocket.dance;
rocketDance('tango'); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'breed' of undefined
```

The above code throws an error because `this` inside `dance` refers to `undefined` when `dance` is called in this manner.

The speaker finally mentions JavaScript's strict mode. When a JavaScript file or function is run in strict mode, it changes certain JavaScript behaviors to prevent common errors. You can enable strict mode by adding `"use strict";` at the top of your JavaScript file or function:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Your JavaScript code here...
```

The speaker suggests that if you're following along using a JavaScript class, your `this` inside isolated methods would be `undefined` in strict mode, while it would default to the `window` object when not in strict mode. 

If strict mode is confusing for you, the speaker suggests not to worry too much about it right now and emphasizes that the concept of `this` will be discussed more in upcoming videos.
