The transcript you've provided is part of an explanation of the `this` keyword in JavaScript, its quirks and complexities. 

The instructor has given an example involving an object `cat` with properties `name`, `breed` and a method `dance`. They have demonstrated how the behavior of `this` changes depending on whether the method is invoked directly from the object or if the method is stored in a separate variable and then called.

Here is a JavaScript snippet of the code in the video:

```javascript
let cat = {
    name: "Blue",
    breed: "Scottish fold",
    dance: function(danceType) {
        console.log(`Meow. I am ${this.name} and I like to ${danceType}.`);
        console.log(`this is: `, this);
    }
};

// Direct invocation from the object
cat.dance("Foxtrot"); // Outputs: "Meow. I am Blue and I like to Foxtrot."

// Store the method in a variable and invoke
let bluesDance = cat.dance;
bluesDance("Salsa"); // Outputs: "Meow. I am undefined and I like to Salsa."

```

The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. In the method `cat.dance`, `this` refers to `cat`. But when the `dance` method is stored in a variable and invoked, it loses its context and `this` defaults to the global window object (or undefined if running in strict mode), which is why `this.name` returns `undefined`.

The instructor promises to provide more details on this topic in the next video, where they will likely delve into methods like `call` and `bind` that can be used to set the context of `this`.

To get a head start, here's a small primer on `call` and `bind`:

1. `call`: This method calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually. 

    Example:
    ```javascript
    bluesDance.call(cat, "Salsa"); // "Meow. I am Blue and I like to Salsa."
    ```

2. `bind`: This method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value.

    Example:
    ```javascript
    let boundBluesDance = bluesDance.bind(cat);
    boundBluesDance("Salsa"); // "Meow. I am Blue and I like to Salsa."
    ```
Both methods allow you to explicitly specify what the `this` value should refer to.
