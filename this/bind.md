The narrator in the audio is explaining the `bind()` method in JavaScript, which is used to create a new function that has its `this` keyword set to a specific object. The new function behaves exactly as the original one but with a different context. The `bind()` method is often used when you want to invoke a function with a specific `this` context multiple times, without needing to specify the context each time (as you would with `call()`).

Here's a summary of what the narrator explained, illustrated with some code snippets:

```javascript
// Suppose we have a Cat object
let Cat = {
    name: 'Blue',
    breed: 'Scottish Fold',
    dance: function(style) {
        console.log(`Meow, I am a ${this.breed} and I like to ${style}.`);
    }
}

// Here is a situation where `this` doesn't refer to the `Cat` object
let danceFunction = Cat.dance;
danceFunction('waltz');  // This will not work as expected, as `this` in the function doesn't refer to `Cat`

// `call` method can be used to call `danceFunction` with `this` referring to `Cat`
danceFunction.call(Cat, 'waltz');  // This works but we have to call it each time

// Instead, we can use `bind` to create a new function with `this` permanently set to `Cat`
let boundDance = danceFunction.bind(Cat);

// Now `boundDance` can be called multiple times and it will work as expected
boundDance('waltz');
boundDance('tango');

// We can create another Cat and bind `dance` function to it
let anotherCat = {
    name: 'Rocket',
    breed: 'Himalayan'
}

let anotherBoundDance = Cat.dance.bind(anotherCat);
anotherBoundDance('chicken dance');  // Now `this` in `dance` refers to `anotherCat`
```

This shows how to use the `bind()` method in JavaScript, a powerful tool for controlling the context (`this`) within functions. It's a way to create a new function where `this` is bound to a specific object, which can be useful in many situations. However, the `bind()` method doesn't call the function; it simply returns a new function where `this` has been bound to a specific object. This new function can then be called whenever it's needed.
